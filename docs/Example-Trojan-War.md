# Example: Trojan War (Hisarlik)

- **Mythic layer:** Homer's *Iliad* (poetic, high-bias).
- **Corroboration:** Hittite texts (e.g., *Wilusa* references).
- **Physical evidence:** Burn layer at Hisarlik, Late Bronze Age.
- **Neutral data:** Migration/coastal records from unrelated cultures.

**Triangulated outcome:** A regional conflict is highly probable; divine interventions excluded.
