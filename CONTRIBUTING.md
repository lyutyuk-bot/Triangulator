## How to Propose Changes
1. Open an issue describing the problem/idea.
2. Fork the repo and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-change`.
3. Commit with clear messages (imperative style).
4. Open a Pull Request referencing the issue and include rationale + sources.

## Evidence Standards
- Prefer primary sources and physical evidence.
- Tag every source with a bias profile.
- Include citations and, when possible, links to open-access materials.

## Code Style (if/when code is added)
- Keep functions small and pure where possible.
- Add tests for the triangulation and confidence scoring logic.
