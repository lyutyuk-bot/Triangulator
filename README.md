 Triangulator – Master Doctrine

Version 1.0.0 — 2025-08-08 18:54 UTC+03:00

**Mission:** Debug history, one myth at a time.

**Core Idea:**  
A dynamic, multi-source history verification engine that strips away political varnish, court-historian bias, and narrative rot.  
The Triangulator rebuilds historical truth by cross-referencing archaeology, hostile sources, neutral accounts, and material culture.

## Core Principles
1. **No single source trusted** — every claim is cross-checked.  
2. **Evidence hierarchy:** Physical > contemporary written > retrospective narrative.  
3. **Dynamic truth:** History updates when new evidence emerges.  
4. **Bias mapping:** Every source is tagged with its likely agenda.  

---

## Core Mechanics
- **Node Mapping:** Each historical claim becomes a node in a 3D network.  
- **Triangulation Engine:** Finds intersections of agreement across at least three independent sources.  
- **Confidence Index:** Assigns probability (%) to each event or detail.  
- **Contradiction Flags:** Highlights radical divergences between sources.  
- **Bias Layer:** Displays political, cultural, or personal motives shaping the source.

---

## Evidence Streams
- **Archaeology:** Excavations, dating, stratigraphy.  
- **Third-Party Observers:** Merchants, diplomats, enemies.  
- **Neutral Cultures:** Accounts from uninvolved parties.  
- **Material Culture:** Artifacts, inscriptions, tools, architecture.  
- **Environmental Data:** Climate records, pollen studies, DNA evidence.

## Example Case — The Trojan War
1. **Mythic Layer:** Homer’s *Iliad* (biased, poetic).  
2. **Corroboration:** Hittite diplomatic texts referencing a Troy-like city.  
3. **Physical Evidence:** Burned strata at Hisarlik matching the proposed date.  
4. **Neutral Data:** Coastal migration patterns from unrelated sources.  
5. **Triangulated Outcome:** A war likely occurred — stripped of divine cameos.

## Output Formats
- **3D Historical Atlas:** Interactive map with shifting probability layers over time.  
- **Timeline Heatmap:** Confidence levels for events by decade/century.  
- **Bias Profile Cards:** Quick-read summaries of source reliability and motives.  
- **Dynamic Revision Logs:** Transparent history of changes when new evidence arrives.

---

## Future Expansion
- **Public API:** For educators, researchers, and the dangerously curious.  
- **Simulation Mode:** Generates plausible reconstructions with visualizations.  
- **Crowd Evidence Portal:** Accepts verified public submissions with confidence scoring.

---

**Tone:** Dry, blunt, allergic to propaganda.  
No comforting stories. Only the messy, inconvenient, unpolished truth.
